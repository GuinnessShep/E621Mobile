        E621 Mobile lets you browse the whole E621 image database and even pick the images you like and download to
        your phone discretely. You can even search for them without any internet connection.
        \n\n
        To do that however, please visit the settings page and click "Force full metadata update". This will download the whole
        tag base from E621, allowing you to search for your downloads using tags. You can do it whenever you want. 
    </string>
    <string name="no_metadata">
        It seems you have not downloaded any tags, so local searching may not work. Please go to the settings screen and click "Force full metadata update".
